Explained inthis link i am just tryingto summarize it, thanks to the auther-> https://packagemain.tech/p/mastering-solid-principles-with-go

**S- Single Responsibility Principle**

“A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.” In go a struct or package should be associated with only 1 thing.

**O- Open-Closed Principle**

“A module should be open for extension but closed for modification” 


**L - Liskov Substitution Principlee**

“If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T may be replaced with objects of type S, without breaking the program” 

**I - Interface Segregation Principle**

“Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.” 

**D - Dependency Inversion Principle**

“Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.”
